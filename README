1. OVERVIEW

The Device Telemetry Stack is a software application that exposes telemetry
about a visitor such as browser capabilities, device size and user agent
information. For client-side programming, it does this through the dts 
Javascript object. Further, it includes functionality to deliver this 
information server-side as well if desired.

==============================================================================

2. INITIATIVE

The Device Telemetry Stack is part of the Mobile Web Framework (MWF) initiative.

The MWF initiative began in early 2010 when the UCLA Office of Information
Technology and UCLA Communications began development of a framework to reach
all campus mobile users via a single platform in a reasonable and cost-
effective manner without imposing any restrictions on server-side environments
or requiring the central aggregation of data.

The MWF went into production at the beginning of Fall 2010 with the launch of 
UCLA Mobile. Two release versions later, the MWF is now used in production by 
more than ten units at UCLA, as well as by six other campuses in the UC system.
A number of other institutions both in the UC and beyond are also currently 
involved in the initiative.

At first, the MWF used user agent sniffing to determine device capabilities.
However, user agent sniffing did not accurately reflect all device capabilities,
simultaneously introducing maintenance challenges in maintaining the metadata
related to these user agents. As such, MWF 1.2 introduced a client-side method
for determining device capabilities and offloading them back server-side.
This new strategy greatly improved the reliability of the Mobile Web Framework 
in addressing device-by-device differences both client-side and server-side.

Borne of a desire to provide this capability beyond even the Mobile Web
Framework, the Device Telemetry Stack is a standalone application that provides
this same range of functionality.
